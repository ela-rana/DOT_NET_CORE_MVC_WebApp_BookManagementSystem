    <b>Cookies</b>: 
    A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects 
    information about engagement on the Services. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, 
    that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also 
    include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
    <br />
    <b>Analytics</b>: 
    We may also use Google Analytics and other service providers to collect and process analytics 
    information on our Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit
